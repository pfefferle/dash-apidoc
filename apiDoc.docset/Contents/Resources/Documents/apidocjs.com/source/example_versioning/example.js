/*
 * Versioning Example
 *
 * This is an versioning example for apiDoc.
 * Versioning keeps previous defined documentation blocks. That makes it possible to compare a methods version with its predecessor.
 *
 * Important is to set the version with "@apiVersion".
 *
 * Documentation blocks without @api (like this block) will be ignored.
